# Vault Additions
This mod adds the `Globe Expander` which is a block that mimics the Border Expansion mechanic from the official Vault Hunters SMP<br>
To increase the World Border, you require `Border Gemstones` which by default have no way of being obtained besides Creative options.<br>
By right clicking on a Globe Expander with a Border Gemstone, it will increase the border inside the Overworld by the given block amount, Inside the Nether & the End, the World Border will be expanded further (8x & 4x multiplier respectively)<br>
The Dimension multipliers & the Border Gemstone increases can be configured in a Config file named `vaultadditions-common.toml` inside the config directory.<br><br>

This Mod requires the [Multi World Borders Unofficial](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/multi-world-borders-unofficial/files/5376292) mod to work properly.<br>
This Mod is both Clientsided & Serversided.
